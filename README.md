The objective for this project was to create a mobile application interface to accommodate useful, contextual, language translation - all whilst delivering exceptional user experience.

TourKing was conceived as a location-based translation application which uses automatic location ‘type’ detection to dynamically anticipate user needs. When entering a place of specific type, such as a restaurant or transport station, TourKing delivers a quickly accessible list of popular phrases for use within that context which the user can make immediate use of. 

TourKing was developed using the Java programming language and XML; it was developed for Android mobile devices using Android Studio.


## Initial Mockups

First initial mockups were developed on Photoshop, making use of the [Material Design kit](https://materialdesignkit.com/android-gui/) for Android Nougat. The mockups were uploaded to the Invision prototyping platform, where the design was open to comments from peers within the Mobile HCI course. The design receieved overwhelmingly positive reviews, so was to be the basis for the final product.



## Final Product

The final product was to be a prototype application which implemented our chosen design. The prototype itself made use of the Google Translate API, as well as native Android text-to-speech and speech-to-text classes. The application itself was hardcoded a location, hence the imagery of Bauhaus in Berlin. If continued into future development, realtime suggestions for phrases and locations would be provided to the user.

Since a prototype application, no .apk file can be downloaded for usage. Please feel free to clone the repo and import the project into Android Studio.
