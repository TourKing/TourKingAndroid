# TourKing
The objective for this project was to create a mobile application interface to accommodate useful, contextual, language translation - all whilst delivering exceptional user experience.

TourKing was conceived as a location-based translation application which uses automatic location ‘type’ detection to dynamically anticipate user needs. When entering a place of specific type, such as a restaurant or transport station, TourKing delivers a quickly accessible list of popular phrases for use within that context which the user can make immediate use of. 

TourKing was developed using the Java programming language and XML; it was developed for Android mobile devices using Android Studio.
